### Content Updates
- Keep expertise descriptions concise but comprehensive
- Maintain balance between technical depth and accessibility
- Update project links when repositories become public
- Refresh metrics.svg regularly (appears to be auto-generated)

### Style Consistency
- Use emojis for section headers and bullet points
- Maintain dark theme throughout
- Keep badge styling consistent across all shields
- Use center alignment for metric displays and social links

## Future Enhancements
- Add actual project repository links when ready
- Include live demo links for projects
- Add research paper/documentation links
- Consider adding a "Currently Working On" section
- Expand the TODO.md with specific improvement tasks

## Technical Notes
- SVG assets stored in /images/ directory
