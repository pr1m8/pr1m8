### **🔹 Architecting Intelligence**
**AI agents are more than just prompts and responses**—they require structured reasoning, modular execution, and real-time adaptability. My focus is on designing **scalable, interpretable, and modular AI architectures** that can dynamically retrieve, process, and act on information.

🔹 **Multi-Agent Architectures** – Building intelligent, cooperative agents with dynamic workflows  
🔹 **Graph-Based AI** – Leveraging structured data to improve reasoning and context understanding  
🔹 **RAG Pipelines & Knowledge Retrieval** – Optimizing AI workflows for efficiency and accuracy  
🔹 **Autonomous Decision Systems** – Integrating real-time adaptation and policy-based execution

### **🔹 Quantitative & Computational Modeling**
AI isn't just about language—it’s about **pattern recognition, probabilistic modeling, and structured intelligence**. My work integrates **quantitative finance, computational models, and AI-driven decision systems** to optimize real-world applications.

📊 **Stochastic & Algorithmic Models** – Applying ML to financial markets, simulations, and predictive modeling  
📈 **Time Series Forecasting** – Building statistical & deep learning models for market predictions  
⚡ **Risk & Portfolio Optimization** – Designing AI-driven investment strategies  
🔢 **Probabilistic Graph Models** – Structuring uncertainty for AI decision-making
